# Autonomous_wheelchair
The aim of this project is to develop a smart autonoumous wheelchair that can create a map from an inexplored indoor place using Lidar sensor and then navigate through it in a secure and accurate way using vector SLAM.

The wheelchair takes vocal commands (to rename places and indicate the destination) through voice recognition. This project was developed using ROS.
